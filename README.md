# Software-Development
Includes a maze solving game modified from original code by Paul Falstad. Includes Eller's maze generation algorithm (http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm) that's really pretty cool. It's been ported over to android so you can download it and play it on your android phone, although it's not the prettiest game out there.
